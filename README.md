# An ActionScript Library for interacting with OAuth 1.0 web services.

> **A note at the beginning:** The only purpose of this project was to get a deeper understanding of how OAuth 1.0 actually works and how a client could interact with OAuth 1.0 services. It is not a production ready implementation. So use only it at your own risk, but please keep in mind that you should by no means use the OAuth Authorization Process implemented in this library for real world application, because therefore you have to store your ```consumer key``` and ```consumer secret``` within your application and it could be reverse engineered and so abused. So it's better to outsource this process on the server to keep your ```comsumer key``` and ```consumer secret``` actually secret. 

An ActionScript 3 library for making authenticated web service request based on the OAuth 1.0 protocol. This library is implemented according to the [OAuth 1.0 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849).

## Overview

This library is built for use with in Flash/Flex/AIR projects to facilitate communication with OAuth 1.0 services. It provides mechanisms to authenticate against OAuth 1.0 servers using all standard authentication and authorization workflows.

### Features

The ActionScript OAuth 1.0 Library supports the following features...

* [x] ability to [fetch temporary credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2.1)
* [x] ability to [authorize a resource owner](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2.2) 
* [x] ability to [fetch token credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2.3) 
* [x] ability to [make authenticated requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3) 
* [ ] provide an OAuthRequestHelper implementing an event based request and response mechanism
* [ ] provide an OAuthHTTPService for using it in a mxml file
* [ ] parse an oauth response into a fully typed object

### Dependencies

* [as3-crypto](https://github.com/jschaedl/as3-crypto)

## Reference

### Installation

The easy way to use this library, is to simply drop in the SWC (or the source) found under ```bin``` folder into your projects ```libs``` folder, along with the appropriate dependencies.

If you use Maven for dependency management, make sure as3-crypto (com.hurlant.as3-crypto) is available in your local maven repository. To install a file in your local maven repository use the following command:

```
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.hurlant -DartifactId=as3-crypto -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=swc -Dfile=libs/as3-crypto.swc
```  

Now you can install as3-oauth with the following Maven command:

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

And after adding the following dependency description to you ```pom.xml```:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.janschaedlich.oauth</groupId>
	<artifactId>as3-oauth</artifactId>
	<version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

you can use this library in your project like the following paragraph demonstrates.

### Further Development

#### How to contribute
If you find bugs or want to enhance some functionality, please fork the master branch, fix the bug you found or add your enhancements and make a pull request. Please commit your changes in tiny steps and add a detailed description for every commit. 

<!---Please make sure that all changes be accompanied by passing unit tests.--->

#### Unit Tests
This library was built using a testdriven development approach and is therefore test covered. To run the units tests under folder ```src/test``` it is necessary that you have a FlashPlayer executable in your ```PATH```. 

You can use the ```getflashplayer.sh``` ShellScript to download and place a current FlashPlayer executable in your projects directory.

```
sh getflashplayer.sh 'http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_11.7.700.225_archive.zip'
``` 
Now run the tests with:

```
mvn clean test -Dflex.flashPlayer.command=Flash\ Player\ Debugger.app/Contents/MacOS/Flash\ Player\ Debugger
```
